# **Rate My Professor with LLM Integration**

This is a Streamlit-based application designed for submitting and interacting with professor reviews. It features a two-page interface where users can submit reviews, rate professors, and interact with a chatbot that retrieves reviews and generates responses based on user queries using a Large Language Model (LLM).

## **Features**
- **Submit Reviews:** Users can input professor names, departments, reviews, and ratings.
- **Star Rating System:** Provides a 5-star rating system for each professor.
- **Embedding-based Search:** Reviews are encoded using `SentenceTransformer` embeddings, stored, and queried using Pineconeâ€™s vector database.
- **LLM Interaction:** A chatbot interface is powered by the Llama 2 model to provide meaningful responses based on professor review data.
